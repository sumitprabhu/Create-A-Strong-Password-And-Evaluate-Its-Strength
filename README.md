# üîê Password Strength Evaluation

## üéØ Objective

To understand what makes a password strong by:
- Creating passwords of varying complexity.
- Testing them using an online password strength checker (e.g., [PasswordMeter](https://www.passwordmeter.com)).
- Analyzing results and understanding best practices.
- Researching common password attacks and how complexity improves security.

## üß™ Password Testing

| Password            | Components Used                              | Length | PasswordMeter Score (%) | Feedback Summary                          |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `password123`       | Lowercase + Numbers                           | 11     | 18%                      | Too common, predictable, lacks symbols    |
| `P@ssword`          | Uppercase + Lowercase + Symbol                | 8      | 50%                      | Moderate strength, too short              |
| `P@ssw0rd2024!`     | Upper + Lower + Number + Symbol               | 13     | 88%                      | Strong password with good complexity      |
| `H4r!3@9L2q^#`      | Upper + Lower + Number + Multiple Symbols     | 12     | 100%                     | Very strong, difficult to guess/crack     |
| `qwerty`            | Lowercase only                                | 6      | 8%                       | Extremely weak, common pattern            |
| `Sumit@5PM`         | Name + Symbol + Number + Upper & Lowercase   | 9      | 52%                      | Medium strength, contains personal info   |

## üõ°Ô∏è Common Password Attacks

| Attack Type         | Description                                                                 | Defense Strategy                           |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Brute Force**     | Tries every possible combination of characters                              | Use long, complex passwords                |
| **Dictionary**      | Tries common words and passwords                                             | Avoid dictionary words and names           |
| **Credential Stuffing** | Uses leaked passwords from other sites                                    | Use unique passwords per account           |
| **Phishing**        | Tricks users into revealing passwords via fake websites/emails              | Enable 2FA, verify site authenticity       |

## üîé Password Complexity & Security

| Complexity Level     | Score | Security Level |
|----------------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| Simple (`123456`)     |   4%   | Very Weak     |
| Moderate (`Password`)  | 26% | Moderate      |
| Strong (`Pass@123`) | 77% | Strong        |
| Very Strong (`Lr1o7dBfHc9*$`) | 100% | Very Strong    |

## Summary & Tips

- The **longer** and **more complex**, the better.
- **Unpredictable** passwords are much harder to crack.
- Use **passphrases** that are long but memorable:
